/*
Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively.
Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index).
The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list
i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.
